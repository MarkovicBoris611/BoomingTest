Hi, I 've completed assignment
I didn't implemented Bonus point but I 'll implement it if you want

1. Implement a "favorites" feature where users can mark photos as favorites. These favorites should persist across browser sessions.
We can use localStorage.
2. Add a filter option to view photos by album ID
We can add one more filter function and input like title search, it can be dropdown
3. Implement smooth transitions or animations when navigating between the gallery and details pages.
We can use serveral transitions and apply it on the top level <div> of the component

I' m looking forward to hearing from you
Regards
